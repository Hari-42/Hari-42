# Hi there! 👋 I'm Hari  

### 🎮 About Me  
I’m a 19-year-old IT student and game developer who loves making cool things and figuring out how stuff works. I spend most of my time coding, working on games, and occasionally sharing my progress on **YouTube**.  

When I’m not glued to my computer, I’m probably at the gym, brainstorming game ideas, or messing around with new tech.
